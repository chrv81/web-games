## About the Project

This is a mini game for you to guess a correct number from 1 to 20. There will be indication for whether or not the you guess right number, or if the number that you input is higher than the correct number, vice versa.

This will check your score to see what is your highest score. You will initially started with a score of 20, each time you guess a number, your score will be minus 1.
In other word, the highest score will be the less time it took for you to guess the right number.
